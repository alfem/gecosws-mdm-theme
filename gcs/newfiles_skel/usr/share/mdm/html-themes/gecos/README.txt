    (What if only one user shows up? Should I open that automatically?)

| Customization         |
+-----------------------+
This theme has a couple settings you may change...

Background
================
> If the picture you want is a .jpg file you can...
    just move whatever picture you want into the folder where index.html is and replace bg.jpg
> Otherwise
    you must edit css/theme.css [line 13] to reflect the name/location of your background file.
    (I *plan* on making this easier in the future...)


Max Users Shown
================
> By default, no more than 4 users (not including the "Other" option) will be shown.
   If you want to change this to more or less, edit index.html [line 14] to the number of users you want shown.


Clock
================
> Hour/minute separator blink
    In index.html [line 12], setting 'shouldBlink' equal to true causes separator to flash, false does not flash.

> 12 or 24 hour clock
    In index.html [line 13], setting clockType to 24 uses a 24 hour clock.  Any other value shows a 12 hour clock.
    (Would you use some different clock type if I included it?)


Ideas? Requests?
================
I have been thinking about different ideas that could go into this theme...
 - Use the selected user's background?
 - Choose a random background from a folder?

...but I probably won't work on that unless someone (you?) lets me know they would like to see a feature added.
